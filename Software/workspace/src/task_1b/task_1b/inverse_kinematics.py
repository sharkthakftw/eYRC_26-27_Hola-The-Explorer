This node subscribes to /cmd_vel (geometry_msgs/Twist: linear.x=vx,
linear.y=vy, angular.z=w) and is supposed to publish the three wheel
speeds it implies on /wheel_commands (std_msgs/Float64MultiArray, ordered
[left, right, back]) for hb_description's bridge_node to apply.

Everything below is scaffolding -- the publisher, the subscriber, the node
setup -- except for body_velocity_to_wheel_speeds(), which is the one part
you need to write. Leave the rest of the file alone.

Usage (once body_velocity_to_wheel_speeds is implemented):
    ros2 launch hb_description task1b.launch.py   # in one terminal
    ros2 run task_1b inverse_kinematics             # in another
    ros2 run task_1b cmd_vel_publisher               # in a third

    Args:
        vx: forward/backward velocity of the chassis, in m/s.
        vy: sideways velocity of the chassis, in m/s.
        w:  yaw rate of the chassis, in rad/s (positive = CCW).

        A sequence of exactly 3 numbers -- the angular speed each wheel
        needs to spin at, in rad/s -- ordered [left, right, back] to match

    TODO: derive and implement the inverse kinematics matrix for this
    robot's 3-wheel omni (kiwi) drive. For each wheel i, driving along
    WHEEL_ANGLES_RAD[i] and sitting CHASSIS_RADIUS_M from the centre:

      1. Each wheel's axle points radially outward, perpendicular to the
         direction it drives in; the wheel can only drive (no slip) along
         WHEEL_ANGLES_RAD[i] -- the passive rollers absorb any motion
         along the axle itself.
      2. Write the chassis velocity at that wheel's position as a function
         of (vx, vy, w).
      3. Project that velocity onto the wheel's driven direction, and
         relate it to the wheel's angular speed through WHEEL_RADIUS_M.

    That gives one equation per wheel; stack the three into a matrix and
    you have your inverse kinematics.
